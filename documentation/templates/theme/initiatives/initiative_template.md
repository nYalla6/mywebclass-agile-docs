"Making a concise and user friendly website"

Description: Essentially following the UX principles and making the website easy to follow.
It should display all of the necessary information in a concise way.

Goals: Creating a calendar, task list, and class-list

Scope: The scope of the project is for the IS218 project.

Outcomes: People will have a satisfactory experience with the app and be less stressed.

Deliverables: Creating the calendar, and add tasks. Add tasks as a component.

Milestones: Calendar, task list, dashboard

Constraints: Limited by time and our abilities, especially for some of the more
complicated connections between the components.

Assumptions: Assuming that it is going to be popular and work. Also that we will have
enough time to get it all done.

Risks: We may have to forgo some tasks because of the constraints.

Dependencies: Dockerhub and github must be working, and we must be able to push and 
communicate well thru that.
