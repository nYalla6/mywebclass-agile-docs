"As a student, I want to be organized so that I can be less stressed and complete all my assignments."

By following this template, you can create user stories that are structured and easy to understand. To make the user story even more effective, you can add acceptance criteria that specify the requirements that must be met to consider the user story complete. Here's an example of a user story with acceptance criteria:

"As a customer, I want to view my order history so that I can track my past purchases."

Acceptance Criteria:

1. The information is clearly visible
2. Navigating is easy and intuitive.
